# SX1262-LoRa-BLE-Relay
These are multipurpose dev boards for the Semtech SX1262 chipset. EBYTE or CDSNET or whatever their name is sell multiple versions of RF modules based on this new LoRa chip on Aliexpress. One of its main advantages is the low RX current draw of about 5ma, which is that of the previous versions cut in half. This project can be used as a Relay between some BLE device and other LoRa nodes to implement a simple off-grid communicator or some day, as soon as LoRaWAN drivers for the SX1262 exist, it can connect to TTN...  
These PCBs are designed for the SPI-versions only (E22-900M30S which is the 1W version and E22-900M22S which transmits at 160mW max). Both are in the 868 and 915Mhz band.  The MCU module is an YJ-18010 which has an nRF52840, a ceramic antenna and low frequency crystal on board. It runs an Feather-nRF52840 bootloader and has roughly the same pinout, at least for UART, SPI and I2C. A 160x80 IPS screen based on the ST7735 chipset and 3 buttons are provided for basic data visualisation and interfacing. The power management is done by this concept: https://github.com/BigCorvus/PowerManager basically without modification. Note that the 30dbm version of the board needs an extra 5V boost converter, which is a G5177C.
